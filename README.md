Submission for the week 1 assignment

## Reflection

I learned to use the flex property, relative and absolute on CSS. Positioning elements on the webpage has been my biggest challenge and these CSS properties have enabled me customize positions on the website.

One of the things I'm still struggling with is the use of technical terms to capture exactly what I want to achieve on the website.

I have not figured how to position elements written onto the webpage with javascript in combination with other CSS elements.
